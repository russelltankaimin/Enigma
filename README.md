# Enigma
Enigma was used by the German Military to encrypt and decrypt messages during the Second World War. It was known that it is one of the most difficult puzzles to crack in that era. However, Professor Alan Turing from the University of Cambridge, with the help of his team at Hut 8 in Bletchley Park, managed to break it with the help of the Bombe Machine. What is beautiful about the Enigma is due to its complexity, with 159 million million million different settings. This project aims to replicate the Enigma M3 Machine with a possible extension of a Bombe machine to deduce the plugboard settings.
